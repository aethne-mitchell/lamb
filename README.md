A small lambda calculus reducer using PLY<br>
Example: (2 * 3) * 2

</p>
The expression is converted into an abstract syntax tree according to the algebraic rules of the lambda calculus system. The beta-reductions are done within the tree structure, and because of this alpha-conversion is not needed. The method of beta-reducing while avoiding naming conflicts and the need to alpha-convert is very simple: in an 'application' subtree, convert each instance of the bound variable in the left child to the right child (the 'argument' expression) unless the variable has 're-rebound' by another 'function' (expression of the form &x.x) further down the tree. Eta conversions have not yet been implemented.
